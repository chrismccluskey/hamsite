In every WordPress page there are many different hooks, but what is the direct relationship among them?

== Description ==

This plugin generates a flowchart for every parent hook that is running under your actual page.   
In Firefox, the flowcharts are JavaScript generated and downloadable in .png format.

From the Setting Page you can choose which parent hook to exlude from the chart.  

Check the screenshots!
